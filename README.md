# notionAPItest
testing out connecting to Notion's API from a GitHub CodeSpace
---
1. attempt to first pull a list of tasks from a specific Notion database and list them on the console in this CodeSpace.
2. once that is working, buid the Node framework necessary to create a "proper" integration that displays the to-do list items in an app. 
3. once THAT is working, add the ability to manage the tasks directly from the app.
4. When all is said and done, we will have a standalone "Notion Tasks" app which we can release on GitHub, as well as a framework useable for other integrations.
